Hi {!Contact.FirstName},<br />
<br />
Thanks for your email,<br />
<br />
Apologies for the delay in coming back to you<br />
<br />
We experienced some issues when one of our main fibre's into Hull was broken at a Road Works site near Scunthorpe last Thursday<br />
<br />
Could I ask that you check your connection now and let me know if it's working now?<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
