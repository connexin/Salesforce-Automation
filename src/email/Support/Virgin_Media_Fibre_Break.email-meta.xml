    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for your email,

Apologies for the delay in coming back to you

We experienced some issues when one of our main fibre&apos;s into Hull was broken at a Road Works site near Scunthorpe last Thursday

Could I ask that you check your connection now and let me know if it&apos;s working now?

Kind Regards,
