    <textOnly>Hi,

Thanks for getting in touch,

We currently have 2 packages for residential: SuperFast Max and SuperFast Lite.

The Max package is £25 per month, for which you get 250GB of data and up to 60Mbps speeds. The network average for this package is 15-30Mbps depending on surrounding terrain, the speed will be confirmed at your site survey.

The Lite package is £18 per month, for which you get 100GB of data and up to 10Mbps speeds. The network average for this package is 4-10Mbps depending on surrounding terrain, the speed will be confirmed at your site survey.

If you wished to upgrade to unlimited you can upgrade on either package this would cost an additional £10 per month or if you&apos;d prefer you can pay £60 upfront for the whole year- that&apos;s a saving of £60 over the year.

Kind Regards,
